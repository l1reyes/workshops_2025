## Introduction:
This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools used with the Python programming language and version control with Git. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems. Participants must bring a laptop with a few specific software packages installed ([listed here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/)).

For more information on what we teach and why, please see our paper "[Best Practices for Scientific Computing](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745)".

**You don't need to have any previous knowledge of programming or the tools presented in the workshop to attend.** A laptop is required for each session.

A Co-Curricular of Record activity recognition may be requested for the student who attend and participate in all sessions and pass the post-workshop quiz.
